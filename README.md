# ChatBot Machine Learning

## Overview

The ChatBot Machine Learning project is a Python-based application that leverages machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide automated assistance for college-related inquiries. The chatbot aims to enhance user experience by delivering quick and accurate responses to user questions.

## Features

- **Automated Assistance**: Provides instant responses to common college-related questions.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to understand and process user inputs.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Employs NLP techniques to interpret and generate human-like text responses.
- **Web Interface**: Offers a user-friendly web interface for real-time interaction.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pranaykarvi/chatBot_machine_learning.git
   cd chatBot_machine_learning
## Methodology
The chatbot is developed using a combination of natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The methodology involves data preparation, model training, and chatbot response generation. The data is preprocessed to remove noise and increase training examples using synonym replacement. Multiple classification models are trained and evaluated to find the best-performing one. The trained model is then used to predict the intent of user input, and a random response is selected from the corresponding intent's responses. The chatbot is developed as a web application using Flask, allowing users to interact with it in real-time.
